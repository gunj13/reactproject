<h2>Deploying using Kubernetes on Minikube</h2>

1. Run these commands based on your OS:
âœ… On macOS (Use Homebrew)
brew install minikube kubectl docker


2. Start Minikube Cluster
Once installed, start Minikube:
minikube start --driver=docker

Verify it's running:
kubectl get nodes

3. Clone the GitHub Repo Locally
git clone https://github.com/gunj13/reactproject.git
cd reactproject


4. Build the Docker Image
Now, build the Docker image for your React app:
docker build -t react-app .

Once done, verify the image was created:
docker images

The Docker Image is available on Docker Hub
gunj13/react-app

5. Apply the config files:
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml
Open a tunnel to access the LoadBalancer 
minikube tunnel

6. Finally check if everything is working:
kubectl get pods
kubectl get hpa
kubectl get services

7. You can then run tests over the application!
